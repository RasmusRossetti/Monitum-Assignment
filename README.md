# Monitum-Assignment

## To start the project

1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the frontend development server: `npm run dev`
3. The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`


**Important:** Update the `apiKey` variable in the `src/pages/Main.tsx` and `src/pages/Stockpage.tsx` files with a valid API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co). The current API key has expired, and you need to generate a new one.

Here's how to obtain a new API key:
- Go to [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co) and sign up or log in to your account.
- Follow their documentation on how to obtain an API key.
- Replace the existing `apiKey` variable's value with the new one in the `Main.tsx` and `Stockpage.tsx` files.
